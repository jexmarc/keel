# Swarm

Fan out N parallel workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

The parent session owns every `spawn_subagent` call. See the keel skill `references/spawn.md`. Workers are leaves. They do not spawn.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers.
4. Pick the worker model from `swarm workers` in `~/.grok/keel.toml` or `.grok/keel.toml` when present. Otherwise use `grok-4.5`. For a model race, name each arm up front (`grok-4.6` vs `grok-4.5`, or two efforts of `grok-4.6`).
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. Use `isolation: worktree`, a branch, or `/tmp/swarm-<slug>/worker-<n>/`.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message with `subagent_type: general-purpose` (or `keel-agent` when the slice is keel-style implementation), `background: true`, and the configured model. Use `isolation: none` when the worker only reads this machine. Use `worktree` when it writes.

There is no Cursor cloud environment and no `cloud_base_branch`. If a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, put the ref in the brief and have it check that branch out, or set `cwd` to an existing worktree.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
